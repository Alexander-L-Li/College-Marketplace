  (You‚Äôll need to create this table as discussed in previous steps.)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Discovered Gaps & TODOs (as of June 8, 2024)

### Backend

- [ ] Implement `/verify-email` and `/resend-verification` endpoints.
- [ ] On registration, generate and email a 6-digit verification code, and create an entry in `email_verification_codes`.
- [ ] Add rate limiting to `/resend-verification` and `/verify-email` endpoints.
- [ ] Replace fake session token in `/login` with JWT or real session management.

### Frontend

- [ ] After successful registration, navigate user to `/EmailVerification` with their email as a query param.
- [ ] Split login and registration into separate `/login` and `/signup` routes for clarity and better UX.

### General

- [ ] Ensure all required fields (e.g., `college`) are always available and validated in both frontend and backend.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Immediate TODOs

### Backend

- [ ] Finalize `/verify-email` logic (code checking, expiry)
- [ ] Add rate limit + cooldown to `/resend-verification`

### Frontend

- [ ] Navigate to EmailVerification after successful signup
- [ ] Animate Confirm Password on password input change
- [ ] Show verification success message after valid entry
- [ ] Create separate `/login` and `/signup` routes

## ‚òëÔ∏è Cursor Dev Strategy

- Use this file as your **central dev hub**
- Convert sections to files, checklists, or side notes
- Use `// TODO:` and `// NOTE:` comments in code to track progress

### 2. Learning-Based Lab: Email Verification & Auth Improvements

#### **Lab Title:**

Implementing Secure Email Verification and Session Management

#### **Lab Goals:**

- Deepen your understanding of backend authentication flows in Node.js/Express.
- Practice designing and implementing secure, scalable endpoints.
- Learn to integrate backend logic with frontend flows.

#### **Lab Steps & Guiding Questions**

---

#### **Step 1: Email Verification Code Generation**

- **Goal:** When a user registers, generate a 6-digit code, store it in the DB, and email it to the user.
- **Questions to Consider:**
  - How will you generate a secure, random 6-digit code in JavaScript?
  - How will you structure the `email_verification_codes` table and ensure codes expire?
  - How will you send the code using your existing `sendEmail` utility?
- **Checkpoint:**
  - After registration, check your DB for a new code and confirm the user receives an email.

---

#### **Step 2: `/verify-email` Endpoint**

- **Goal:** Create an endpoint that checks the code, marks the user as verified, and handles expiration.
- **Questions to Consider:**
  - How will you query for the code and check its expiration?
  - How will you update the user‚Äôs `is_verified` status?
  - What error responses should you return for invalid, expired, or already-used codes?
- **Checkpoint:**
  - Test with valid, invalid, and expired codes. What responses do you get?

---

#### **Step 3: `/resend-verification` Endpoint with Rate Limiting**

- **Goal:** Allow users to request a new code, but rate-limit requests to prevent abuse.
- **Questions to Consider:**
  - How will you implement rate limiting for this endpoint? (Can you reuse your existing logic?)
  - How will you handle resending codes for already-verified users?
  - How will you update or replace old codes in the DB?
- **Checkpoint:**
  - Try resending codes multiple times‚Äîdoes the rate limit work? Are codes updated in the DB?

---

#### **Step 4: JWT Session Management**

- **Goal:** Replace the fake session token in `/login` with a real JWT.
- **Questions to Consider:**
  - What information should you include in the JWT payload?
  - How will you sign and verify JWTs securely?
  - How will you handle token expiration and invalidation?
- **Checkpoint:**
  - After login, inspect the JWT. Can you decode it? Does it contain the right info?

---

#### **Step 5: Frontend Integration**

- **Goal:** Update the frontend to navigate to `/EmailVerification`
